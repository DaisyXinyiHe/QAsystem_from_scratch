# QA system from scratch in Python

Repository of building Question and Answer chatbot system from scratch or other NLP techniques

* Transformer_Arch.ipynb: Tranformer architecture from https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks
* QA_transformer_from_scratch.ipynb: Using the above transformer architecture + adding a QA head to build a QA model. Trained on the SQuAD train dataset. However, need to refine tokenizer as there are some tokens in validation dataset that might not exist in training dataset.
